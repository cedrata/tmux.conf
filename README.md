# Tmux config
This is my tmux configuration and I've created this repository to keep a portable configuration for my tmux.

# Contents
In the `tmux.conf` all references, inspirations and credits are avilable, e.g. sessionizer is an idea of The Primeagen that I really liked and wanted to bring in my workflow.

# Requirements
To make this configuration working some dependencies are required:
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
