# Tmux config
This is my tmux configuration and I've created this repository to keep a portable configuration for my tmux.
In the `tmux.conf` all references, inspirations and credits are avilable, e.g. sessionizer is an idea of The Primeagen that I really liked and wanted to bring in my workflow.

# Requirements
To make this configuration working some dependencies are required:
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

# Installing
Type in your terminal `$ git clone https://github.com/cedrata/tmux.conf.git ~/.config/tmux`
Now you're ready to go!
